## Background

YouTube metrics are distracting. I often find myself prematurely forming opinions of YouTube videos before even watching one minute.

I built this chrome extension to fix that.

Pick and choose what biases to hide. I personally only have likes and comments hidden for most videos, but I hide all biases for potentially controversial content.
